# Pomodoro Timer App

Developed a simple Pomodoro timer app. The Pomodoro Technique is a time-management framework which is as simple as it is effective - you use a timer to break your work into time blocks (usually 25 minutes), separated by a 5 minute break. After every 4 pomodoros, you can take a longer break. This app was a recreation of Cynthia Lee's Pomodoro Clock app. 

The timer will toggle between starting and pausing when you click the "start" button. Once the timer reaches zero, an alarm will go off. A work session is always followed by a break session. The work and break durations can be modified.
The "reset" button will (you guessed it) reset the timer.
